What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository is created and the files contained in it are not automatically tracked / added to the repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains the files that will be commited to the repository.
Working directory, contains the files that have been modified, but not added to the Staging area.
